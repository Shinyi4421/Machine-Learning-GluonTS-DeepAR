Hello everyone,<br>
I have been working as a sales representative in the computer industry for six years. With the buzz around machine learning being so strong, <br>
I decided to give it a try and learn how to create a machine learning project. I spent three months studying related courses, <br>
and this is the result of those three months. Although it's a beginner's work, <br>
it took a lot of time and effort. If you're also looking to learn or need to create an assignment or report but lack inspiration or ideas, <br>
feel free to take a look at this rough project for reference.<br>

This small project uses the command pip install "gluonts[torch]" to install the necessary packages. I also optimized the code based on the guidelines provided by PyTorch.<br>
The model used in this project is DeepAR from the GluonTS library. For a detailed introduction, you can refer to the website linked at the bottom.<br>

In the environment_details.txt file, you will find all the details about the environment and packages I used. <br>
To ensure that the code runs smoothly, I strongly recommend creating a separate environment for this project. <br>
This is because you may encounter unforeseen package conflicts. If that happens, <br>
I suggest deleting the environment and setting it up again, as it will save you time in the long run.<br>

The entire project was developed using Anaconda's Jupyter Lab. You can open the code in Jupyter Lab to run this small project.<br>

The SQL database was managed using MariaDB. However, if you have other preferred options, you can use them as well—it won't affect the project.<br>

The data in the Data_raw folder comes from the websites listed in the Data Sources Analysis section. <br>
The training dataset covers the period from 2015 to 2023, and the test dataset used for prediction spans from March 2023 to March 2024. <br>
My approach was to import all the data into an SQL database, where I performed feature engineering. <br>
This involved using mathematical operations to transform the raw data into a format that the machine learning model can quickly learn from during training. <br>
Although my explanation might sound basic, the concept is roughly like that—haha. If you decide not to use an SQL database, you can directly work with the CSV files instead.<br>

The Data_toSQL folder contains data that I have already processed and refined. <br>
You can refer to my approach, but it’s not the only way to handle the data—I'm open to suggestions! <br>
The next step is to use the to_ListDataset.ipynb notebook to transform your prepared feature-engineered data into a file that can be used for model training. <br>
I chose to use the pkl file format, based on the recommendations I gathered.<br>

Next, use the DeepAR_model_train.ipynb notebook to start training the model. <br>
Please note that I’ve added extensive GPU monitoring information here because I've received numerous reports from clients about damaging their GPUs. <br>
If you set parameters that exceed your GPU's memory capacity, <br>
this code will immediately terminate the operation and warn you, preventing potential hardware damage. <br>
Although more damaged GPUs might boost sales as people buy replacements, that’s not my main goal—haha.<br>

Finally, you can use the deepar_forecast.ipynb and dash.ipynb notebooks to create and visualize your results. <br>
By default, the training results generated by DeepAR_model_train.ipynb are stored in the Model directory, but you can adjust this and update the code with your new directory path. <br>
The Data_Plotly folder contains the CSV files used for running dash.ipynb, and the test_data folder includes the data from my initial experiments, which you can refer to as a guide.<br>
